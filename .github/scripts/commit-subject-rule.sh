# The rule commit subjects are held to, in the one place everything that

# A rule written down in three places is three rules waiting to disagree.

# This file is sourced, not run. It defines what its callers use.

# after the version it declares and `chore(release): 1.2.1` is the clearest
# thing that commit can say.

Subjects follow Conventional Commits:

  type(scope): summary in the imperative, lowercase, no full stop

type is one of build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style
or test. scope is the module or feature the change lives in and may be left out
when a change is genuinely project-wide.

CONTRIBUTING.md has the reasoning and an example of a good message body.
